# Punk API exercise

Using the üç∫ [Brewdog Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) (no authentification required üëç) and ‚öõ[React](https://reactjs.org) + [React Native Web](http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs), you will create a single page application with a simple form to search and display a beer list as you type.

Feel free to [personnalize](http://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/?path=/docs/guides-style--page) your app with a kickass style ‚ú®.

You can use **TypeScript** or **JavaScript** (pick the one you feel the most confident with).

By default, `src/JavaScript/App.js` file will be used as entry point. To switch and use the `src/TypeScript/App.tsx` file, set the `USE_TYPESCRIPT` variable in `src/index.tsx` to `true`.

üëâ The result will be published on your GitHub account.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
